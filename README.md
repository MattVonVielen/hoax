hoax
====
Yet another mocking library for Erlang.

Build
-----

hoax requires [rebar][1] to build. To build hoax, go to the hoax
directory and simply type:

```sh
rebar compile
```

To make sure hoax works on your platform, run the tests:

```sh
rebar eunit
```

_Note that hoax's unit tests require Eunit >= 2.2.1 (OTP R14B04)._
